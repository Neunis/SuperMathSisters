# Researh Questions
Can we establish an easy to use product, so we asked the below questions:
- How easily players could move the avatar around the world using the WASD/arrow keys controls as well as the spacebar to jump? 
- Is 30 seconds enough time to complete the level based on the format and structure of number selection?
- How much was the automatic equation checker liked?
- How comfortable are players able to select numbers using the E/Enter key?

# Evaluation Process
- Participants filled out a consent form 
- Participants were asked basic questions like, age, gender, gaming experience
- Then, the participants were each seated in front of a computer running Super Math Critter
- The participants were asked to read the instructions
- Then, the participants played the two levels
- For the participant to complete the level, they must correctly answer the equation in the level
- If they failed to complete a level, they were asked to try again
- After the two levels completed, the game was turned off
- The participants filled out a questionnaire by themselves
